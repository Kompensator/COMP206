* In my case, using a Makefile is much better than using a shell script to compile due the modular nature.
* For example, if I modifify common.c which is used by main.c, sum1.c and sum2.c, make would compile
all the source files and link them
* But if I modify sum2.c, it would be inefficient to recompile the other files. All we need is:
$ gcc -c main.c
$ gcc -o sum main.o common.o
* Makefile allows me to only recompile what needs to be recompiled, while a shell script would always recompile
the whole thing and be less efficient.
