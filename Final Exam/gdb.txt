$ gdb a.out
(gdb) break 6
(gdb) break 11
(gdb) run
hello,world (input into program)
(gdb) print buffer
(gdb) print *buffer
(gdb) continue
(gdb) print ptr
(gdb) print *ptr -> Cannot access memory at address 0x0

b)
This line gives error because the buffer[1000] we created in getInfo() is local to the function,
and it existed on the stack until getInfo() finished executing. When we try to print ptr which points
to the start of buffer[1000], the char array already got erased because getInfo finished executing, so
we end up printing nothing.
